# Population Projections Czechia
This Python code visualizes age dependency ratios for the Czech Republic, separating them into overall, young, and old age dependency ratios.  This can be helpful for understanding population trends and planning for social services.

## User Guide
This script requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib (for plotting)

## Data Source
The code retrieves data from the World Bank's Population Estimates and Projections:
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037655/Population-Estimates-and-Projections dataset.

## How to Use
1. **Save the code:** Save this code as a Python file (e.g.,*population.p*y).
2. **Ensure libraries are installed:** Make sure you have pandas and matplotlib installed in your Python environment. You can install them using: pip install pandas matplotlib.
3. **Run the script:** Execute the script *population.py*.

**The script will**
- Read the population data for the Czech Republic.
- Calculate the overall, young, and old age dependency ratios.
- Generate three separate plots visualizing these ratios over time.


## Explanation of Plots - INDICATORS

- **Age Dependency Ratio:** Age dependency ratio is the ratio of dependents--people younger than 15 or older than 64--to the working-age population--those ages 15-64. Data are shown as the proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.
- **Age Dependency Ratio, Old:** Age dependency ratio, old, is the ratio of older dependents--people older than 64--to the working-age population--those ages 15-64. Data are shown as the proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.every 100 working-age adults.
- **Age Dependency Ratio, Young:** Age dependency ratio, young, is the ratio of younger dependents--people younger than 15--to the working-age population--those ages 15-64. Data are shown as the proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.

## Additional Notes

- The script assumes the data file (Population-EstimatesEXCEL.csv) is in the same directory as the script itself.

## Conclusion
In the Czech Republic, the population is aging. According to the World Bank, the proportion of the population that is over 65 years old is expected to increase. This will have a number of challenges for the Czech Republic, including:

- **A smaller workforce:** The Czech Republic already has a relatively low birth rate, and the aging population will further reduce the size of the workforce. This could make it difficult for the country to maintain its current economic growth rate.

- **A higher dependency ratio:** The dependency ratio is the number of dependents (people who are not working) for every 100 people of working age. The aging population will increase the dependency ratio in the Czech Republic, which could put a strain on the social security system.

- **A shortage of healthcare workers:** The Czech Republic already has a shortage of healthcare workers, and the aging population will only make this problem worse. This could lead to longer wait times for healthcare and poorer quality of care.
